This file outlines the preliminary timeline and milestones for the project.
This project tries to follow the standard data analysis process, featuring the following steps:
1. Data Exploration and Data Preprocessing
2. Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing
3. Data Mining and Machine Learning
4. Data Visualization

but excluding the following steps due to the limit of our data source:
1. Data Collection
2. Implementation of analysis system
3. Monitoring and Maintenance
4. Deployment
