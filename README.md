## Project Description
This project aims to analyze and visualize phone data for 2024. It involves statistical analysis, data mining, and visualization to extract insights and trends. Tasks will be updated weekly to reflect progress and upcoming work.

This project is a personal project aiming to analyze and visualize the phone usage data in 2024. The project will simulate the data analysis process in a real-world scenario and featuring:
1. Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing
   1. Conduct tests, interpret results, and draw conclusions.
2. Data Mining and Machine Learning
   1. Focus on intrepretable models and techniques. Ensuring the reliability and interpretability of the results.
3. Data Visualization
   1. Interactive and informative visualizations.
   2. Animate the visualizations
   3. Focus on the storytelling aspect of the visualizations.

## Outline and Timeline

Timeline are now available in [Timeline-and-Milestones](./Project-Timeline/Timeline-and-Milestones_2024-11-17.md).

## Data Source

The data is from Kaggle: [Phone Information 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/phone-information-2024). This dataset contains the phone model from 2017 to 2024, including the phone model, the release date, the price, specifications, and other information.

The [data overview](./data_overview/data-overview.md) provides a description of the dataset and its structure. It also tracks the data processing and cleaning steps.

## Analysis Process

This project tries to follow the standard data analysis process, featuring the following steps:
1. [Data Exploration and Data Preprocessing](./documentation/Data-Processing-and-Exporation.md) (Available at **Week 1**)
2. [Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing]() (Available at **Week 3**)
3. [Data Mining and Machine Learning]() (Available at **Week 4**)
4. [Data Visualization]() (Available at **Week 5**)
5. [Interpretation and Conclusion]() (Available at **Week 7**)

but excluding the following steps due to the limit of our data source:
1. Data Collection
2. Implementation of analysis system
3. Monitoring and Maintenance
4. Deployment

The project is expected to be completed in **8 weeks**. And the final report will be available by then.
After the completion of the project, the project will also be available on my Personal Website [Here](https://www.example.com).

## Tools

Data preprocessing and transformation will be done in `Python`.
Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing will be done in `Python`.
Data Mining and Machine Learning will be done in `Python`.
Data Visualization will be done in `Tableau` or `D3.js` for interactive visualizations. `Python` will be used for animated visualizations.
